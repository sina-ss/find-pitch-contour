# Find Pitch Contour

In this project, we will process the following sentence spoken in both English and Persian:

"In many examples that we discuss in this book, it is necessary to change the sampling rate of a discrete-time signal." (page 47, line5)

The English voice is stored in a file named `voice-en.mp3` and the Persian voice is in `voice-fa.mp3`.

Our goal is to obtain the pitch contour of these voice signals using three different methods:

1. Average Magnitude Difference Function (AMDF)
2. Autocorrelation
3. Cepstrum
